<b>What is LUSTRE?</b></br>


Welcome to LUSTRE. LUSTRE stands for Lancaster University STatistics REsources, and is an online catalog and repository designed to encourage best practice in data management and open data for students in Psychology and related disciplines. LUSTRE holds project information and digital resources.

LUSTRE has been designed to meet several teaching and research aims:

a) LUSTRE provides a platform to train students in data management and encourage open data standards. We believe that in order to foster open data practices and illustrate the benefits of good data stewardship, it is vital that students have experience and training in data cataloguing. LUSTRE helps bring data management into a teaching curriculum and highlight the benefits that this can bring.

b) LUSTRE increases the availability and functionality of student projects by providing an online catalog. We hope to improve quantitative analytic skills among students, through a forum that organises project data. By curating projects, it becomes easier to envisage how data that fuel them cannot be recycled and used in teaching. That is, to the extent that the teaching of analytic skills and approaches can be embedded in real world data, peer-created and managed, we hope to increase engagement in data science skills.

c) LUSTRE offers a project repository that acts as an informational resource that can be interrogated and used to by students to learn about past projects pics and details - what projects have been attempted, who supervised them, what was undertaken, and how. All of this information can help students make better informed choice about their own project scope.

LUSTRE builds on the omeka platform providing a free, flexible, and open source web-publishing platform for the display of digital collections and exhibitions
